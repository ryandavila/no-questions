# no-questions
No Questions is a pet project that started as a joke between friends.

So I decided to make a way to log all the dumb questions we've asked each other while learning some full stack along the way.

# Technical Stuff
No Questions is currently built with üç¶JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js/Express on the backend with MongoDB for our data needs. It'll be an evolving project of mine when I have free time to make improvements and add new features!

# Future Additions
Some things I would like to work on in the future include...

## Frontend
Reimplement the frtonend in React, and possible Vue at some point.
Add user feature and social aspect to the app.

## Backend
Possibly reimplement the backend with some other language such as Java.
Move from MongoDB in order to learn other platforms

# Other Stuff
Nothing, yet...

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to email me with any suggestions you think the app could use!
